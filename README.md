# FAQ

### Q: How can i make apps for it? <br/>
A: Just wait until i make the wiki part of this repository and you will know :)

### Q: How can i contribute? <br/>
A: You can clone RobloxOS on the game page on Roblox or do modifications to the scripts and kindly ask me to put it into RobloxOS

### Q: Is this turning into a Linux distro of sorts? <br/>
Short answer: No

Long answer: i wish i could turn this into a full on Linux distro but i don't have the Albert Heinstein brain to do that. So until someone decides to turn this into a Linux distro i won't be in anyway doing that myself
